# jsblockrogue
A roguelike written in javascript using blockly programming

This is a pet project to practice my javascript.

The concept is a simple roguelike game, but where the player characters behaviours are programmed instead of manually controlled. 

As a roguelike, the rapid hardcore death mechanics match well with typical programming cycles of test and improvement.

This is written in javascript, mainly because I need to learn that language, but also to use the rot.js and blockly libraries.
